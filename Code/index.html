                    If you have played Final Fantasy XIV,<br>
                    you probably know the feeling of stepping into a new world full of possibilities,<br> 
                    engaging stories and new friends to be made.<br><br> I want to build the foundations for those worlds.<br><br>

                    Hello my name is Marcelo. I was born and raised in Brazil,<br>
                    where I studied mechatronics engineering for 3 and a half years<br> which gave me greater understanding about algorithms, math and physics. <br><br>
                    I’m studying game programming at St Lawrence college<br> where I have learned JavaScript, C++, APIs and Unity.<br>
                    I’m also studying Unreal engine 5 on my own<br> using Youtube videos, documentation, and Udemy courses.<br>
                    I’m currently working on creating my own games using Unreal Engine 5.<br>
                    I’m proud of my works with Unreal Engine 5 and uploaded them in github page.<br><br>

                    I want to participate in a project of a big RPG game<br> and to give other people the same feeling that I had years ago.<br>
                    If you are interested in my ideas, feel free to contact me with the email box below.<br><br>
