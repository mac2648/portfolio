            <h2>Game Programmer</h2>
            <p>
                I am a gameplay-focused game programmer with experience building a wide range of systems in Unreal Engine, working comfortably across both C++ and Blueprints. My work spans core gameplay mechanics and supporting systems, including AI behavior, turn-based combat, quest and dialogue systems, node-based world elements, and multiple types of user interfaces.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am accustomed to working in collaborative development environments and contributing to features from early implementation through iteration and refinement. While Unreal Engine is my primary toolset, I also have experience with Unity, and I am comfortable working with Git-based workflows for version control and collaboration.

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                I have around a year and a half of professional experience working on game development projects, and over three years when including my academic background. I enjoy working on gameplay mechanics and systems design, with a focus on building features that are clear, maintainable, and scalable as projects evolve.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                My work has primarily been within small teams of four to five people, often as the sole programmer. This has required close collaboration with designers and artists, and in some cases direct involvement in design decisions to help translate gameplay ideas into practical implementations. I value clear communication and iteration, especially when refining systems based on playtesting and feedback.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                From a technical perspective, I approach problems methodically and aim to structure systems in a way that supports long-term growth, while continuing to improve my architectural and design practices through experience. Given the current state of the industry, I remain flexible in my specialization and am comfortable focusing more deeply on the areas a project or role requires.

                        <b>Modular Quest Architecture:</b><br>
                        I designed a flexible, step-based quest system where quests are composed of interchangeable steps that can be combined in different ways. This approach allows designers to build a wide variety of quest behaviors by assembling predefined step types, enabling rapid iteration and strong design freedom without requiring code changes.
                        <br>
                        <b>Flag-Driven Dialogue System:</b><br>
                        The dialogue system is built around a flag-based state model that allows NPCs to react dynamically to player actions, quest progress, and previous dialogue choices. Flags can be set by both quests and dialogues, enabling branching conversations and evolving narrative responses while keeping the system data-driven and designer-friendly.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h5>Technical Challenge & Solution</h5>
                    <p class="project-description">
                        To keep the dialogue flag system performant and readable, I used enums to represent dialogue states. However, Unreal Engine’s reflection system limits Blueprint-exposed enums to TEnumAsByte, which caps the number of usable values and reduced flexibility as the project grew.
                        To solve this, I implemented a custom struct paired with an IPropertyTypeCustomization, allowing designers to work with a large, readable set of dialogue flags directly inside the editor while bypassing the 255-value limitation. This maintained runtime performance while significantly improving editor usability and long-term scalability.

                    <p class="project-description">
                        <b>Dynamic Object Selection UI:</b><br>
                        I implemented a UI system that automatically resizes and adapts based on the number of available objects, without requiring manual layout adjustments from designers. Using C++ with NativeConstruct and NativePreConstruct, the UI dynamically builds and scales its content, reducing designer overhead and improving tool robustness.
                        <br>
                        <b>Node-Based Surface Customization with Instanced Meshes:</b><br>
                        I developed a node-based surface system using Instanced Static Mesh Components, allowing designers to create surfaces of arbitrary size while enabling players to customize each node individually. Since instanced meshes cannot have unique materials per instance, I implemented a data-driven material system where instance data defines which texture and texture region is applied per node, enabling per-node visual customization while maintaining performance.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h5>Technical Challenge & Solution</h5>
                    <h5>Performance and Material Constraints in Large Editable Surfaces</h5>
                    <p class="project-description">
                        The initial implementation used individual actors per surface node, which quickly became a major performance bottleneck. Migrating to Instanced Static Meshes solved the performance issue but removed per-node material flexibility.<br>
                        To restore customization, I redesigned the material workflow to use texture atlases and per-instance data for texture selection. To mitigate atlas limits, I collaborated with the texture artist to create mini texture atlases and planned texture grouping strategies, allowing a large variety of surface appearances while maintaining rendering efficiency and scalability.
